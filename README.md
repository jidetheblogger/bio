# Bio — Static personal website

This repository contains the source code for a small static personal website (HTML, CSS, and optional JavaScript).

2. Open index.html in your browser, or serve the directory locally:
   - Python 3: python -m http.server 8000
   - Node (npm): npx serve .
3. Make edits to the HTML/CSS/JS files and refresh the browser to see changes.

Deploying

Notes

- This README is intentionally minimal. If you want more detailed setup or build steps (for example, a pipeline that compiles styles or bundles assets), tell me what tooling you prefer and I can add instructions.
